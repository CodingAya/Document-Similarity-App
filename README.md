# Document-Similarity-Application

The Document Similarity Application aims to compare the cosine similarity between two documents, thus the app can be used to detect plagiarism, for instance.

"Cosine similarity" is the cosine of the angle between two n-dimensional vectors in an n-dimensional space. It is the dot product of the two vectors divided by the product of the two vectors' lengths or magnitudes.

Values range between -1 and 1, where -1 is "perfectly dissimilar" and 1 is "perfectly similar".
